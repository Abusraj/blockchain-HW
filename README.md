--
## This project helps you understand blockchain (inside out). 
### You will implement your own blockchain from scratch using Python. You will test your blockchain by creating
### transactions, mining blocks, and add them to the blockchain. You will synchronize
### blockchains between nodes. You also need to add extra features, like network difficulty
### and obfuscation, the more the better
